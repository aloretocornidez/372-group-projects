### Lab 4
This lab consists of controlling a DC motor with the atmega2560 microcontroller. A potentiometer conrols the motor speed and direction. A button is present that pauses the movement of the motor, whenever the motor is paused, a 7-segment display counts down from 9 seconds. After the display reaches zero, the system resumes operating the motor by using the potentiometer reading.
